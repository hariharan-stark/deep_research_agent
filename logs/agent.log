FEEDBACK: Looks good. The report is comprehensive, well-structured, and all claims are thoroughly supported by the provided findings. The source verification is robust, and the risk score justification, while making a nuanced interpretation regarding "unethical behavior" in the context of corporate actions, is adequately supported by the direct naming in a shareholder lawsuit and leadership during major corporate crises. No hallucinations or significant inconsistencies were found.

FEEDBACK: The report is generally well-structured and comprehensive, with a justified low-risk score. However, there is one specific claim in the "Deep Fact Extraction" section that is not explicitly supported by the provided findings snippets, which constitutes a hallucination based on the strict evaluation criteria.

**Specific Issue:**
1.  **Hallucination/Unverified Claim**: Under "1. Deep Fact Extraction" -> "Biographical details" -> "Education", the claim "Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology [Britannica Money]" is not explicitly supported by the provided snippet from Britannica Money. The snippet only mentions his Master's degree from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. While this is a commonly known fact about Satya Nadella, for a strict QC review against *provided findings*, it must be verifiable within those findings.

**Action Required:**
*   Please either remove the claim about the Bachelor's degree from Manipal Institute of Technology or provide a finding snippet that explicitly supports it from the cited source (Britannica Money) or another provided source. If no such snippet exists in the provided findings, the claim must be removed.

FEEDBACK: The report is well-structured and largely accurate, but there are two instances where claims are not explicitly supported by the provided findings snippets, or are an inference rather than a direct statement.

1.  **Hallucination/Source Verification Issue (Deep Fact Extraction - Education)**:
    *   **Claim**: "Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology [Britannica Money](https://www.britannica.com/money/Satya-Nadella)"
    *   **Finding**: The `Britannica Money` snippet provided in the findings (`"After moving to the United States, he completed (1990) a master's degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee and went to work at Sun..."`) does not mention his Bachelor's degree from Manipal Institute of Technology or Electrical Engineering. While this information might be on the full Britannica page or Wikipedia, the report specifically cites Britannica Money, and the provided snippet does not support the claim.

2.  **Source Verification Issue (Deep Fact Extraction - Behavioral Patterns)**:
    *   **Claim**: "Supports Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs within Microsoft [NYT Business](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/business/dei-programs-initiatives-costco-microsoft.html)"
    *   **Finding**: The `NYT Business` snippet (`"In October, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft..."`) mentions Nadella in the context of DEI programs but does not explicitly state that he *supports* them. It's an inference based on the article's broader topic, not a direct statement from the provided text.

Please ensure all claims are directly verifiable from the provided findings snippets.
