A significant portion of her net worth is attributed to her GM stock holdings and strategic investments [Mirror Review](https://blog.mirrorreview.com/mary-barra-net-worth/), [BusinessWomen](https://businesswomen.com/profiles/mary-barra/). Beyond GM, she was elected to The Walt Disney Company Board of Directors on August 24, 2017, a role for which she earned $361,657 in cash [Disney Newsroom](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/mary-t-barra-general-motors-co-chairman-ceo-elected-walt-disney-company-board-directors-2/), [Phoebe Wall Howard](https://phoebewallhoward.substack.com/p/can-mary-barra-helm-gm-while-juggling).

*   **Behavioral patterns**:
    Barra's leadership style is characterized by building upon success and a strong crisis response [IEDP](https://www.iedp.com/articles/leadership-journeys-mary-barra/), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0363811116300935). She redefined GM's purpose and values, emphasizing a customer-centric approach [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-barra).

She has also engaged in efforts to reassure staff during challenging times, such as with GM's Cruise autonomous vehicle division [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/180286y/general_motors-ceo-mary-barra-tries-to-reassure/).

### 2. Risk Pattern Recognition

*   **Flag potential red flags (fraud, legal issues, controversies)**:
    Mary Barra has been directly named in a shareholder class action lawsuit filed in December 2023 against General Motors, concerning vehicle safety issues [D&O Diary](https://www.dandodiary.com/2023/12/articles/securities-litigation/vehicle-safety-issues-trigger-securities-suit-against-gm/). She led GM during the significant ignition switch recall crisis in 2014, which resulted in congressional testimony and internal investigations [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/gm-officials-say-they-expect-mary-barra-will-be-cleared-of-wrongdoing.html), [DeGette House](http://degette.house.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/gm-expands-ignition-switch-recall-later-models). While GM officials expected her to be cleared of personal wrongdoing in that instance [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/gm-officials-say-they-expect-mary-barra-will-be-cleared-of-wrongdoing.html), the event was a major corporate controversy under her leadership. GM has also faced "mounting and massive transmission woes" leading to online outrage, with some sources suggesting Barra has "dodged legal bullet" in relation to these issues [Deadline Detroit](https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32644/starkman_gm_s_mounting_and_massive_transmission_woes_sparks_online_outrage_as_barra_dodges_legal_bullet/). Furthermore, GM has been involved in bankruptcy court proceedings where "allegations of fraud" were made against the company [World Finance](https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/legal-management/gm-back-in-bankruptcy-court-as-allegations-of-fraud-are-made/). Her board membership at Disney also places her in proximity to legal actions pursued by Disney investors [Phoebe Wall Howard](https://phoebewallhoward.substack.com/p/can-mary-barra-helm-gm-while-juggling). A plaintiff's attorney sought her deposition in a case, though arguments were made that she was not personally involved [Esquire Solutions](https://www.esquiresolutions.com/georgia-sets-new-ground-rules-for-deposing-high-level-executives/). There are no findings of personal fraud, bankruptcy, or criminal convictions against Mary Barra.

*   **Confidence score**: 8/10.
    The biographical, professional, and financial details are well-corroborated across multiple reputable sources, including official company pages, established news outlets, and academic institutions. Information regarding legal issues and controversies is also widely reported. The confidence score is high due to the consistency and reliability of the sources.

*   **Cross-reference facts and note any unverified claims**:
    Facts were cross-referenced using multiple sources where available. Claims regarding "allegations of fraud" against GM in bankruptcy court are noted as being against the company, not personally against Barra [World Finance](https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/legal-management/gm-back-in-bankruptcy-court-as-allegations-of-fraud-are-made/). The phrase "dodging legal bullet" in relation to GM's transmission issues is an interpretive statement rather than a verified legal outcome against Barra personally [Deadline Detroit](https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32644/starkman_gm_s_mounting_and_massive_transmission_woes_sparks_online_outrage_as_barra_dodges_legal_bullet/). While she was expected to be cleared of wrongdoing in the ignition switch crisis, the crisis itself and her leadership role are verified facts [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/gm-officials-say-they-expect-mary-barra-will-be-cleared-of-wrongdoing.html).

### 5. Risk Score Calculation

**Risk Score: 7 (High)**

**Justification**:
Mary Barra's risk score is assessed as "High" due to her direct involvement in significant legal actions and her leadership role during major corporate controversies. Specifically, she has been named as a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit concerning vehicle safety issues at General Motors [D&O Diary](https://www.dandodiary.com/2023/12/articles/securities-litigation/vehicle-safety-issues-trigger-securities-suit-against-gm/). Furthermore, she was the CEO during the widely publicized GM ignition switch recall, a major corporate crisis that led to congressional testimony and extensive regulatory scrutiny [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/gm-officials-say-they-expect-mary-barra-will-be-cleared-of-wrongdoing.html). The company has also faced ongoing product quality issues, such as "transmission woes," leading to public dissatisfaction and potential legal exposure [Deadline Detroit](https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32644/starkman_gm_s_mounting_and_massive_transmission_woes_sparks_online_outrage_as_barra_dodges_legal_bullet/). While there are no findings of personal fraud, criminal convictions, or bankruptcies, the direct naming in a significant legal action and her leadership during multiple high-profile corporate legal and safety crises meet the criteria for "Significant legal actions" and "patterns of unethical behavior" (referring to corporate actions under her leadership) within the "High" risk category.
